# ColorfulMemory

Experts say humans can only store 7 things in short-term memory. Let's see if we can prove them wrong!  
  
ColorfulMemory is a simple game with a simple objective. Colors will flash on the screen, all you have to do is memorize them! Enter the colors back in the correct order to go to the next level.

Difficulty modes range from "tutorial" all the way to aptly named "impossible" mode. The higher the difficulty, the more points you can earn!

How colorful is your memory?
